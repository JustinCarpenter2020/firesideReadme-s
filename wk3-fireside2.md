# Rebuilding Vender

## Main Focus:
<p> This fireside primarily focuses on reviewing how to build out an MVC project. When building out vender put emphasis on each step of the process from html => controller => service => trigger a listener => draw </p>

<ul>
<li> One of the best concepts to show in this fireside is the ternary on a model, really explain this concept as it will be important later
<br>
<li> The models and wire framing for the functions will be built out, as well as the items to buy in the proxy state, make sure to run over this code. However none of the onclicks or registering will be done as we want to show this to them as a reminder(controllers in the main.js)
</ul>
