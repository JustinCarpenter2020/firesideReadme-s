# MVC MoonMiner

## Main Focus:
<p> This fireside primarily focuses on rebuilding moon miner in MVC. It'll also be ideal if we can show off UX-UI, modals, and sweet alerts.
 </p>

- The models will be prebuilt, as well as the upgrades in the proxy state make sure to run the class over this code. 
<br>
-Leave the buttons unlinked, show the process from start to finish from button click => controller => service => triggers listener to draw
<br>
- Put the upgrades in a modal to show off how that will work
<br>
- If time show off sweet alerts toasts and confirm action
