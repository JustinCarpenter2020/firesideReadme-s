# Rebuilding RPS

## Main Focus:
<p> This fireside primarily focuses on building out RPS the way the students would originally (with a lot of v-else's). Then we move on to progressively more efficient methods, including ternaries, switch statements, a dictionary, and a dictionary utilizing .includes() </p>
<ul>
<li> Between each method make sure to ask for questions and describe how it works
<br>
<li> The app.js will be divided into sections make sure to stick to the solutions for that section
</ul>
