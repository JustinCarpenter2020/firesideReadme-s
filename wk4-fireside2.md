# Rebuilding Pokedex

## Main Focus:
<p> This fireside primarily focuses on reviewing the flow and process of creating an MVC project with async code. The PokeApi is known for having hard to access content, this is a perfect opportunity to show off models(using methods inside of models, digging deep enough to pull of the image, etc) as well as properly logging your data. </p>

<ul>
<li> If time permits try to show off a ternary on the model, maybe change the color of the text based off the pokemon's type
<br>
<li> This fireside is a great review for the checkpoint so make sure to stop and ask for questions throughout
</ul>
