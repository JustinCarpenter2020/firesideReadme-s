# Building Inspire Backend

## Main Focus:
<p> This fireside primarily focuses on the crud methods for todos(create, remove, update, delete) as well as using axios in the backend to call to an api. </p>

<ul>
<li> This is a perfect time to show them the flow of how to build a backend, make sure you're doing one route at a time and testing between each.
<br>
<li> Make sure to have postman up, this is how you will test each route as you finish it  
<br>
<li> This project does not use Auth, it has not been introduced yet
</ul>
