# Gregslist debug

## Main Focus:
<p> This fireside primarily focuses on giving students key tips and tricks to debugging MVC/async code. The students will be debugging a broken project one step at a time with you there to help if they get stuck. </p>

<ul>
<li> Put emphasis on common syntax issues such as, invoking a function in a listener, forgot to register controller, missing awaits, MISSING .JS ON IMPORTS.
<br>
<li> These firesides are great for students to learn how to traverse their own code, enforce good debugging practices: logging the res, asking questions like "What were we expecting to happen", reminding them they can use debuggers, read every error code.
</ul>
